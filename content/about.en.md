<p>Don't worry!
This is a WIP, I'm still thinkin about how I'm going to do this.
So calm down (please).</p>

<p>This website is used for personal notes about my learning process, 
    both so that I can review the content when necessary and to share it as support material for other people.</p>

<p>As if this and all the learning involved were not challenging enough, 
    I decided to complicate my life even more and make an English version of it, 
    both to learn more about multilingual mode on a website and to practice my writing in English. 
    The idea is not to translate the content completely directly, but rather to rewrite it as much as possible, 
    but that is not a promise.</p>
