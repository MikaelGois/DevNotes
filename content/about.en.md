Don't worry!
This is a WIP, I'm still thinking about how I'm going to do this.
So calm down (please).


This website is used for personal notes about my learning process, 
both so that I can review the content when necessary and to share it as support material for other people.


As if this and all the learning involved were not challenging enough, 
I decided to complicate my life even more and make an English version of it, 
both to learn more about multilingual mode on a website and to practice my writing in English. 
The idea is not to translate the content completely directly, but rather to rewrite it as much as possible, 
but that is not a promise.


The idea came from the realization that notes could help to consolidate the understanding of the topics studied. 
In addition, whenever I felt the need to review or consult something, I would have the written content for that.


In a previous work experience, I, together with another coworker, 
developed the habit of writing several tutorials, or "How To" as we called them.
We kept a repository on GitHub and a drive with these documents to help the department in carrying out tasks.
This started from the need of documentation of the content (which was non-existent at the time), 
and evolved into elaborate tutorials. This change occurred in part because our writing was initially direct and more technical, 
which made the content understandable for us, but perhaps not for the other people in the department, 
so I started to break the content into small parts and provide a complete explanation of what was happening and why.
This way, anyone, even a new hire with no experience in IT, could understand what was written there. 
This approach was followed by my colleague, who understood the need to have a writing style that was so "intuitive" 
for other people, so to speak.


Another factor that influenced this decision was Akita's approach to [akitaonrails.com](https://akitaonrails.com), 
where he writes notes and scripts for his videos on his YouTube channel. 
This served as inspiration for starting the notes and also for the tool that would be used, 
in this case [Hextra](https://github.com/imfing/hextra), which, 
in addition to being a well-designed tool and using Markdown and LaTeX to write the pages (features that I consider important), 
won me over with the possibility of implementing the project with GitHub Pages. 
In addition, the devs provide a template that makes implementing the project much easier.
