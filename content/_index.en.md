title: Mikael Gois's notes
toc: false
---


Here I write some notes (oh come on) of a personal nature, 
the English version of these notes, 
almost like a conversation with myself (which may indicate symptoms of schizophrenia). 
The writing is informal and occurs without constancy, 
if you are interested in knowing more and understanding why this is so, 
read the ["About"](about) page.
