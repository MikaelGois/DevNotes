October is the tenth and third-to-last month of the year in the Gregorian calendar, lasting 31 days. October owes its name to the Latin word octo (eight), since it was the eighth month of the Roman calendar, which began in March.

October is the month of Medicine, Dentistry, Physiotherapy and Pedagogy. And nationally it is the month for breast cancer prevention and women's health, through the Pink October campaign.

October always begins on the same day of the week as January, except when the year is a leap year.

Apparently the lack of productivity wasn't just in September, as I also couldn't publish anything in October. I hope November will be better!
