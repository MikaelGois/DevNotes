November is the eleventh and penultimate month of the year in the Gregorian calendar, and the second-to-last month of the year, lasting 30 days. November owes its name to the Latin word novem (nine), as it was the ninth month of the Roman calendar, which began in March. November was the ninth month of Romulus' calendar c. 750 BC. November retained its name (from the Latin novem meaning "nine") when January and February were added to the Roman calendar.

November is a late spring month in the Southern Hemisphere and a late autumn month in the Northern Hemisphere. Therefore, November in the Southern Hemisphere is the seasonal equivalent of May in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa. In Ancient Rome, Ludi Plebeii was held from November 4th to 17th, Epulum Jovis was held on November 13th, and the Brumalia celebrations began on November 24th. These dates do not correspond to the modern Gregorian calendar. November was referred to as Blōtmōnaþ by the Anglo-Saxons. Brumaire and Frimaire were the months in which November fell in the French Republican calendar.
